# Styled Components with React and Typescript

This guide provides an overview of using Styled Components with React and Typescript to create reusable and easily manageable CSS-in-JS code. Styled Components is a powerful tool that allows you to write styling directly within your React components, providing a more modular and organized approach to styling.

## Getting Started

To get started with Styled Components in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

## Folder Structure

The recommended folder structure for Styled Components in React projects follows the best practices:

```
src/
  styles/
    Theme.ts
    Global.ts
    Breakpoints.ts
    Fonts.module.css
```

The `styles` folder contains four main files that are essential for organizing your Styled Components.

### Theme.ts

The `Theme.ts` file is used for theming in Styled Components. It allows you to define colors, fonts, padding, margins, and other configurations that can be used throughout your application. Using TypeScript with Styled Components provides the advantage of IntelliSense for theming.

### Global.ts

The `Global.ts` file contains global styles for your application. It is where you can reset default styling and define font, color, and background properties. This file ensures consistency in styling across your entire application.

### Breakpoints.ts

The `Breakpoints.ts` file is used to handle responsive design using media queries. It defines different breakpoints for various screen sizes, allowing your application to adapt and provide the best layout to users. By using media queries in Styled Components, you can easily adjust styles based on the device width.

### Fonts.module.css

The `Fonts.module.css` file is used to import and define font styles for your Styled Components. It includes font-face declarations for different font weights and allows you to use custom fonts in your application.

## Usage

To use Styled Components in your React components, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary components from `styled-components`.
2. Use the `ThemeProvider` component to wrap your application and provide the theme.
3. Define your styled components using the `styled` function and pass in the desired HTML element or component.
4. Use the theme variables and breakpoints defined in the `Theme.ts` and `Breakpoints.ts` files to style your components.
